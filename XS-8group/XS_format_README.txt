Each material folder contains a file called xs.txt, which contains multigroup macroscopic cross section data for a homogenized region.
The meaning of the values in each column are shown below.
Each row represents a different energy group, with group 0 corresponsing to the highest energy values and group N-1 having the lowest energy values

Column 0		    Column 1	Column 2	    Column 3	    Column 4+m, m=0...N-1					                Column 4+N+m, m=0...N-1							                        Column 4+2N                                                                                 Column 5 + 2N
[energy group n]	[total XS]	[total scat XS]	[nu_sigma_f]	[differential scattering XS from group n to group m]	[first moment of differential scattering XS from group n to group m]	[fission chi (probability of a fission-produced neutron being created in energy group n)]   [Q (inhomogeneous neutron source)]
